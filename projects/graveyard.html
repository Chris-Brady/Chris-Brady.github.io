                            Grave Mistake is a mod made for Skyrim played out as a self contained game. This was made as part of a game design module which required us to make a mod for skyrim that didn't just add new content to the game, but rather was a whole new game using the Skyrim assets/engine.<br><br>
                            This game introduces the Player as a Grave Robber with the objective of acquiring loot in a Graveyard level. The level is decorated with many statues, one of which is picked to be an enemy NPC. The NPC will attempt to hunt down the player while the player is not looking at him/her, freezing back into a statue when entering the Player’s view.
                            If the NPC reaches the Player before they can escape with the loot, the game ends and the player loses.

                            It was a cold night in the town of Terminus, but there was work to be done. The heads of seven of the richest houses had been buried that day, and there were treasures buried with them. You, a crafty grave robber, have made your way to the churchyard to see what bounty you can collect.
                            Little did you know that the soul of the once feared “Terminus Killer” has been awakened by the deaths of these evil men, and is now out for blood.
